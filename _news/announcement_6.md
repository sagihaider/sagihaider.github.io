I’m delighted to share that I have been awarded a Royal Society International Exchanges grant to support a new international research collaboration between the University of Essex and AIIMS New Delhi, India.

The project, “AI for Oral Health: Exploring Mobile-Based Artificial Intelligence for Early Screening of Oral Pre-Cancer and Cancer”, will run from January 2026 to December 2027. It focuses on developing mobile-based AI and computer vision tools to support early detection of oral cancer, particularly in low-resource and community settings.

This collaboration will involve bilateral research visits, close clinical–technical collaboration, and joint academic outputs, with the long-term aim of improving early diagnosis and public health outcomes.

I’m grateful to the Royal Society and all collaborators for their support, and I look forward to progressing this impactful work.
