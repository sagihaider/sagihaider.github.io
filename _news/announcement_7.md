Royal Society Pairing Scheme 2026 – Successful Selection

---

I am delighted to share that I have been selected for the Royal Society Pairing Scheme 2026, a highly competitive national programme that connects leading UK researchers with parliamentarians and senior civil servants. Following a competitive process with over 300 applications, I will take part in the Week in Westminster (16–19 March 2026), where I will shadow a policymaker, engage in policy-focused workshops, and gain first-hand insight into how scientific evidence informs decision-making at the heart of government.

This opportunity aligns strongly with my work in AI, healthcare, and responsible innovation, including my entrepreneurial activities through Sensiwise AI and the SAIRA (Sensiwise AI Readiness Assessment) framework. I look forward to contributing to and learning from this important dialogue between science, innovation, and policy.
