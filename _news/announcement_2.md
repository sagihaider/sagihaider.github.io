We are thrilled to announce our special session, "Data-efficient Vision Transformers: Challenges & Applications", which will take place during the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (<a href="https://2025.ijcnn.org/">IEEE IJCNN 2025</a> 2025) in Rome, Italy, from 30 June to 5 July 2025.

## About the Session
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are reshaping computer vision with state-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, their dependency on large datasets often limits their potential in real-world, data-scarce scenarios. This special session focuses on innovative methods to enhance data efficiency in ViTs, including self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and generative augmentation strategies.

## Why Attend?
Explore cutting-edge techniques for optimising ViTs for low-data regimes.
Engage with experts from academia, industry, and research institutions.
Discover real-world applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and more.
Participate in discussions on future directions and emerging challenges.
