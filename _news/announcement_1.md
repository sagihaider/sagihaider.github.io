Currently, I do not have any open funded PhD positions. However, if you are interested in pursuing a self-funded position, please feel free to email me your CV along with a two-page research proposal (including references).

Additionally, I recommend contacting the University of Essex admissions team to explore funded programmes and [opportunities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/opportunities) and [funding](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/fees-and-funding/scholarships-and-funding) available at the university.
