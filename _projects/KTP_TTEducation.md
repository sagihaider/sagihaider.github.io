The project aimed to develop an innovative CPD (Continuous Professional Development) tracker powered by AI and embedded machine learning, designed to monitor and enhance staff performance comprehensively. This tool would not only track progress but also analyse performance data to identify effective strategies for professional growth. By providing senior leaders with actionable insights and a clear development roadmap, the CPD tracker was intended to drive improvement across the organisation and establish industry-wide benchmarks for success.

Unfortunately, the project was left incomplete due to the significant disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which impacted the company's operations and resource allocation. Despite the setback, the concept remains a promising initiative that could significantly contribute to workforce development and organisational excellence when revisited in the future.
