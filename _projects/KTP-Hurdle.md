Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming precision medicine by enabling more accurate biomarker discovery. Biomarkers play a vital role in diagnosing disease, predicting risk, monitoring treatment, and supporting clinical trials. Chronomics (trading as Hurdle) aims to strengthen its innovation capacity by embedding advanced AI/ML techniques into its biomarker pipeline. This project will develop an AI-enabled biomarker discovery engine, integrating multimodal datasets such as time-series, imaging, and electronic health records. The outcome will be new, commercially viable risk prediction tools, advancing public health while positioning Hurdle to expand in the global precision medicine market.
