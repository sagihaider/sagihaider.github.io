Secured £204,671.98 in research funding as the principal investigator (PI) from Innovate UK, in collaboration with Check4Cancer (UK), to develop a state-of-the-art AI engine for detecting melanoma-based skin cancer lesions. As part of this project, we have hired a post-doctoral researcher who developed explainable AI and other computer vision-based methods to launch a robust AI model within a mobile app, with a particular emphasis on minimizing false negatives. We have access to the Check4Cancer dataset, which consists of dermoscopic and digital images, along with metadata collected over the past two decades.

We Published a range of papers: {% cite islam2024machine}
You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
