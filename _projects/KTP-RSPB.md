This project brings together the University of Essex and the RSPB to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help people understand the truth about nature-friendly farming. Sometimes, inaccurate or misleading information spreads online and makes it harder for organisations such as the RSPB to promote positive environmental action. The project will create smart AI tools that can detect misinformation and help the RSPB share clear, trustworthy messages based on real evidence. By improving how the RSPB communicates, the project will build public trust, support sustainable farming, and help protect nature and wildlife for future generations.
