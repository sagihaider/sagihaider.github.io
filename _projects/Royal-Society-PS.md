**Project Summary**  

I have been selected for the Royal Society Pairing Scheme 2026, a prestigious programme that connects leading UK research scientists with parliamentarians and civil servants. As part of the scheme, I will take part in a Week in Westminster (16–19 March 2026), attending policy-focused workshops, engaging with senior policymakers, and shadowing my paired parliamentarian or civil servant to gain first-hand insight into how evidence informs decision-making. This will be followed by a reciprocal visit to my home institution, where I will introduce my research in artificial intelligence and innovation. The scheme strengthens dialogue between science and policy, supporting evidence-based governance and public benefit.
