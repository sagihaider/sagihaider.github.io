The KTP Project with Storm Technologies aims to design and implement an AI-driven data intelligence and process optimisation framework to enhance data flow, decision-making, and operational efficiency across the business. The project will map and evaluate existing data pipelines from suppliers to customers, build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for cross-sell recommendations, and integrate machine-learning models into upstream (procurement and supply-chain) and downstream (sales and customer engagement) operations. The project concludes with full commercialisation, capability building, and a long-term AI innovation roadmap, embedding data-driven practices within Storm Technologies for sustainable digital transformation.
