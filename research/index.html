Since then, I have delved into various facets of AI. The word cloud presented below showcases the key themes and keywords encapsulating my research endeavors.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/wordcloud.png" width="400" align="center"></p> <p>The picture that changed my life is given below. The picture is from the book <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</code> by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The first chapter of the book is an introduction to AI and I read it in 2007. I would say no one can explain it much better than this book.</p> <hr> <p>The methodological contributions are given as follows:</p> <p>1) <strong>Domain Adaptation</strong>: In the domain of machine learning, my focus has been on the convoluted field of Domain Adaptation, where I have contributed by developing innovative learning methods. The primary objective has been to develop models with the capability to adeptly navigate and adjust to non-stationary environments, effectively addressing the challenges posed by changing distributions. This involves creating adaptive mechanisms that allow the model to dynamically evolve and refine its understanding based on shifts in data patterns, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios. By delving into the intricacies of domain adaptation, my work strives to enhance the adaptability of machine learning models, making them more resilient and versatile in the face of evolving datasets and real-world fluctuations. </p> <p>2) <strong>Change/Shift Detection</strong>: My significant focus has been directed towards the development of a robust Change/Shift Detection method, a critical component in the domain of data analysis. This method is specifically designed to effectively identify covariate shifts within datasets, functioning seamlessly in both online and retrospective modes. The key objective is to create a sophisticated algorithm that can dynamically recognize alterations in the distribution or characteristics of the data, whether in real-time or during a retrospective analysis. This innovation contributes to the realm of adaptability in machine learning systems, ensuring that models are equipped to detect and respond to shifts in data patterns, thereby maintaining optimal performance across various scenarios. By addressing the challenges of covariate shift detection, my work aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of machine learning models, making them more adept at navigating the dynamic nature of real-world data environments. </p> <p>3) <strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs)</strong>: In the pursuit of advancing computer vision methodologies, my research has been centred around the development of innovative techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, my focus extends beyond conventional practices that heavily rely on pre-trained ImageNet weights. Instead, I am actively engaged with my PhD students in the designing and implementation of methods to train lightweight ViTs from scratch. This approach not only aims to reduce reliance on generic pre-trained weights but also tailors the model to be more resource-efficient and adaptable to specific domains. Furthermore, recognizing the critical significance of healthcare imaging data, I am directing efforts towards the creation of a specialized ViTs model exclusively tailored for the complexities of medical imaging. This involves a detailed exploration of the unique characteristics and challenges posed by healthcare datasets, ensuring that the model is finely tuned to extract meaningful insights and patterns relevant to medical diagnostic applications. The overarching goal of this research is to contribute to the evolution of vision transformers, making them more versatile, domain-specific, and resource-efficient, particularly in the context of crucial domains such as healthcare.</p> <hr> <p>The following are my areas of Applied AI research:</p> <ol> <li><a href="#BCI">EEG/MEG-based Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></li> <li><a href="#healthcare">Healthcare and Predictive Analytics</a></li> <li><a href="#env-agri">Environmental Sciences and Agriculture</a></li> <li><a href="#eng-arch">AI in Engineering and Architecture</a></li> </ol> <hr> <p><strong>1. EEG/MEG-based Brain-Computer Interfacing <a name="BCI"></a></strong></p> <p>A major issue in bringing real-world applications of machine learning outside the laboratory is the difference in the data distributions between training and testing stages or domains. The diverging statistical properties in different domains can lead to decay the prediction performance. The technical term for a change in the distribution of features is covariate shift, which also happens to be a common challenge in electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI); this is due to the presence of non-stationarities in the EEG/MEG signals. The non-stationary nature of EEG/MEG signals makes an EEG/MEG-based BCI a dynamic system, thus improving its performance is a challenging task. A lot of adaptive machine learning approaches have been developed and used previously to tackle this challenge such as passive and active approach for learning, domain adaptation, transfer learning, covariate shift minimization, deep learning, and more. I am particularly interested in developing methods for covariate shift adaptation in both EEG/MEG datasets. To visualize the covariate shift generally scatter plot and histogram are used. I am also interested in exploring new ways of analysing, visualizing, and measuring the covariate shift in data.</p> <p align="center"> <img width="600" height="250" src="/assets/images/bci.jpg"> </p> <p>Here is a list of key projects:</p> <ol> <li> <p><em>EEG-based BCI</em>: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that enables direct communication between the brain and external devices by interpreting and decoding electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It allows users to control devices or applications using their brain activity, bypassing traditional motor pathways. However, there are several challenges in transitioning this technology from the laboratory to real-world applications, including signal quality and variability, spatial and temporal resolution, feature extraction, inter-subject variability, dataset and covariate shift, calibration, and training on non-stationary datasets. To address these challenges, I have made significant contributions to the field. Firstly, I helped develop a covariate shift detection test\cite{raza2015ewma} and an adaptive learning algorithm\cite{raza2016adaptive} to adapt to non-stationary datasets. Additionally, I proposed a novel framework, the covariate shift estimation-based adaptive ensemble learning, to handle non-stationarity in motor imagery-related EEG-based BCI \cite{raza2019covariate}. The online BCI system developed through this research is still actively used by the BCI lab at Ulster University. Furthermore, I conducted an evaluation of four methods for frequency band selection in binary motor imagery classification, namely forward-addition (FA), backward-elimination (BE), the intersection, and the union of FA and BE. These methods automatically select and learn the most discriminative sets of frequency bands and their corresponding Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features. The findings from this study were published in the proceedings of IEEE-IJCNN 2015\cite{raza2015optimising}. Through my research, I have made significant contributions to advancing the field of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface technology, addressing key challenges, and developing novel methodologies. I won the best literature review award sponsored by McGraw Hill during my PhD degree at the Univerisity of Ulster.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>MEG-based BCI</em>: MEG has several advantages over EEG. First, MEG provides more precise spatial localization of neural activity since magnetic fields are less distorted by the skull and scalp compared to electrical signals. Second, MEG has a higher temporal resolution, capturing neural activity in real-time with millisecond accuracy. Third, MEG is less susceptible to artifacts from muscle movements and has a better signal-to-noise ratio. MEG systems are expensive and hence MEG datasets are not readily available for researchers to develop effective and efficient BCI-related signal processing algorithms. In 2021, we released 306-channel MEG-BCI data recorded at 1KHz sampling frequency during four mental imagery tasks (i.e. hand imagery, feet imagery, subtraction imagery, and word generation imagery). The dataset contains two sessions of MEG recordings performed on separate days from 17 healthy participants using a typical BCI imagery paradigm. The recorded dataset is the only publicly available MEG imagery BCI dataset as per our knowledge. The dataset can be used by the scientific community towards the development of novel pattern recognition machine learning methods to detect brain activities related to motor imagery and cognitive imagery tasks using MEG signals. This work was published in Scientific Data, Nature in 2021\cite{rathee2021magnetoencephalography}. Additionally, I collaborated with neuroscientists from the Basque Centre on Cognition, Brain and Language, Donostia/San Sebastian, Spain; Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain; and Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen, Gießen, Germany to decode numeracy and literacy in the Human Brain and we found that numbers are represented stronger single letters, but a string of letters is represented stronger than a string of numbers. The work has been accepted for publication in Scientific Report, Nature\cite{nara2022decoding}.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stroke Rehabilitation</strong>: The aim of the study was to design a BCI-operated neuro-rehabilitation system that would ensure recovery of the patient’s finger motions so that the patients can get back their independence in performing their activities of daily life and improve their quality of life. We proposed a novel algorithm Cortico-Muscular-Coupling (CMC)\cite{chowdhury2019eeg} and implemented it with covariate Shift Adaptation based BCI system for Personalized Neuro-Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients\cite{chowdhury2017online}. With my team members at IIT-Kanpur, India, we have conducted experiments on $10$ healthy and $10$ stroke subjects. The activities involved in this project are the development of a CMC-based single-trial EEG classification method for decoding user intentions, a novel method for feature extraction using correlation in EEG and EMG signals, conducting experiments on healthy subjects \&amp; stroke subjects, deriving results from the analysis, and finally, the impact on the patient\cite{chowdhury2018active} to recover the motor activities.</p> </li> </ol> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Haider Raza.
