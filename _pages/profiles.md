I am keen to collaborate with researchers and professionals who share a passion for advancing AI and its applications. My research interests span a range of AI-driven domains, including decision-making, machine learning methods, non-stationary learning, brain-computer interfaces, EEG/MEG signal processing, computer vision, and computational intelligence solutions for healthcare, businesses, and environmental challenges.  

At [Sensiwise AI](https://sensiwise.ai/), I lead all initiatives related to artificial intelligence, bringing years of experience and expertise in developing AI-driven solutions. My areas of focus include AI for healthcare, covering robotics, medical imaging, and diagnostic systems such as skin cancer detection. I also specialise in machine learning, explainable AI (xAI), and their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. With a strong track record of addressing challenges in healthcare systems and influencing policies for ethical AI adoption, I ensure Sensiwise AI delivers innovative, reliable, and impactful solutions that empower businesses and improve lives.

If you are enthusiastic about any of these topics and are looking to collaborate on impactful AI projects, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. Let’s work together to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve!

## Academic and Industry Collaboration

I also actively collaborate with the leading people in the academia and industries. Here is a list of my existing and past collaborations: 

#### King-George Medical College, Lucknow, India

One of my key collaboration is with King George Medical College, Lucknow, India with whom we have signed a data-sharing agreement. We aim to develop an accurate computer vision-based diagnostic system for age-group estimation using dental X-ray images and this work is extremely important in forensic dentistry and for various medico-legal purposes. We are working with [Dr.Akhilanand Chaurasia](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-akhilanand-chaurasia-56b15b92) who is an Assistant Professor & Consultant King George's Medical University, India. 


#### Muhammad Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), UAE. 
I have collaborated with Dr. Muhammad Haris Khan from Muhammad Bin Zayed University on advancing research in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on vision transformers and domain adaptation. Our work aims to address challenges in generalising visual recognition systems across diverse and dynamic data domains, contributing to the development of robust and adaptable AI models.

#### Ulster University, Northern-Ireland, UK

I have actively collaborated with Dr. Saugat Bhattacharya and Professor Girijesh Prasad from Ulster University on pioneering research in brain-computer interfacing (BCI), focusing on developing adaptive learning techniques for non-stationary systems to enhance the efficiency and reliability of EEG-based BCI systems. This partnership has significantly contributed to advancing innovative solutions in neural engineering and human-computer interaction.

#### IIIT-Lucknow, India

Jointly working with Dr Vishal Krishna Singh from IIIT-L who now joined University of Essex. We worked on advancing in AI that could be used in solving major global environmental crises--from climate change to agriculture. With advances in machine learning and deep learning, we can now tap the predictive power of AI to make better data-driven models of environmental processes to improve our ability to study current and future trends, including forest-fire, water availability, crop-monitoring, and ecosystems wellbeing. I am interested in bringing AI and ML to play a key role in enhancing environmental decision and policy-making work, by bringing algorithmic solutions to the following themes:

* Developing forest-fire prediction algorithm using IoT
* Image analysis for monitoring crops
