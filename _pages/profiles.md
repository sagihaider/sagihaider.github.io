I am interested in collaborating and working with potential researchers who are interested in working on AI. My research interests and activities focus on the AI for decision-making, machine learning methods, non-stationary learning, brain-computer interface, EEG/MEG signal processing, computer vision, and computational intelligence methods for healthcare, businesses, and environment. I work on the development of intelligent systems and practices my skills in the following programming languages- Python, Matlab, and R. So, please feel free to get in touch if you are passionate about any of the above-mentioned topics.

## Academic and Industry Collaboration

I also actively collaborate with the leading people in the academia and industries. Here is a list of my existing and past collaborations: 

### IIIT-Lucknow, India

Jointly working with IIIT-L ([Dr Vishal Krishna Singh](https://iiitl.ac.in/index.php/personnel/dr-vishal-krishna-singh/)) on advancing in AI that could be used in solving major global environmental crises--from climate change to agriculture. With advances in machine learning and deep learning, we can now tap the predictive power of AI to make better data-driven models of environmental processes to improve our ability to study current and future trends, including forest-fire, water availability, crop-monitoring, and ecosystems wellbeing. I am interested in bringing AI and ML to play a key role in enhancing environmental decision and policy-making work, by bringing algorithmic solutions to the following themes:

* Developing forest-fire prediction algorithm using IoT
* Image analysis for monitoring crops 

### King-George Medical College, Lucknow, India

One of my key collaboration is with King George Medical College, Lucknow, India with whom we have signed a data-sharing agreement. We aim to develop an accurate computer vision-based diagnostic system for age-group estimation using dental X-ray images and this work is extremely important in forensic dentistry and for various medico-legal purposes. We are working with [Dr.Akhilanand Chaurasia](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-akhilanand-chaurasia-56b15b92) who is an Assistant Professor & Consultant
King George's Medical University, India. 

### Ulster University, Northern-Ireland, UK

### East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, UK
