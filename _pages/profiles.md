I am keen to collaborate with researchers and professionals who share a passion for advancing AI and its applications. My research interests span a range of AI-driven domains, including decision-making, machine learning methods, non-stationary learning, brain-computer interfaces, EEG/MEG signal processing, computer vision, and computational intelligence solutions for healthcare, businesses, and environmental challenges.  

At [Sensiwise AI](https://sensiwise.ai/), I lead all initiatives related to artificial intelligence, bringing years of experience and expertise in developing AI-driven solutions. My areas of focus include AI for healthcare, covering robotics, medical imaging, and diagnostic systems such as skin cancer detection. I also specialise in machine learning, explainable AI (xAI), and their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. With a strong track record of addressing challenges in healthcare systems and influencing policies for ethical AI adoption, I ensure Sensiwise AI delivers innovative, reliable, and impactful solutions that empower businesses and improve lives.

If you are enthusiastic about any of these topics and are looking to collaborate on impactful AI projects, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. Let’s work together to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve!
