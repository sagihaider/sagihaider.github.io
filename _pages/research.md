My passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning sparked during my BTech Degree at Integral University, Lucknow, India, in the academic year 2007-2008. Since then, I have delved into various facets of AI. The word cloud presented below showcases the key themes and keywords encapsulating my research endeavors.

The picture that changed my life is given below. The picture is from the book ``Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach`` by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The first chapter of the book is an introduction to AI and I read it in 2007. I would say no one can explain it much better than this book.

The methodological contributions are given as follows:

1) **Domain Adaptation**: In the domain of machine learning, my focus has been on the convoluted field of Domain Adaptation, where I have contributed by developing innovative learning methods. The primary objective has been to develop models with the capability to adeptly navigate and adjust to non-stationary environments, effectively addressing the challenges posed by changing distributions. This involves creating adaptive mechanisms that allow the model to dynamically evolve and refine its understanding based on shifts in data patterns, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios. By delving into the intricacies of domain adaptation, my work strives to enhance the adaptability of machine learning models, making them more resilient and versatile in the face of evolving datasets and real-world fluctuations. <!-- [UKCI'14] , [BIBM'14], [IJCNN_1'15], [IJCNN_2'15], [SC'15], [IJCNN'16], [TCDS'17], [NC'18], [IJCNN'19], [IJCNN_1'20], [IJCNN_2'20].

2) **Change/Shift Detection**: My significant focus has been directed towards the development of a robust Change/Shift Detection method, a critical component in the domain of data analysis. This method is specifically designed to effectively identify covariate shifts within datasets, functioning seamlessly in both online and retrospective modes. The key objective is to create a sophisticated algorithm that can dynamically recognize alterations in the distribution or characteristics of the data, whether in real-time or during a retrospective analysis. This innovation contributes to the realm of adaptability in machine learning systems, ensuring that models are equipped to detect and respond to shifts in data patterns, thereby maintaining optimal performance across various scenarios. By addressing the challenges of covariate shift detection, my work aims to enhance the reliability and accuracy of machine learning models, making them more adept at navigating the dynamic nature of real-world data environments. <!-- [SMC'13](https://sagihaider.com/publication/2013_06_IEEE_SMC), [AIAI'13](https://sagihaider.com/publication/2013-06-EWMA_Springer), [PR'15](https://sagihaider.com/publication/2015_04_EWMA_Pattern_Recognition) -->

3) **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: In the pursuit of advancing computer vision methodologies, my research has been centred around the development of innovative techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, my focus extends beyond conventional practices that heavily rely on pre-trained ImageNet weights. Instead, I am actively engaged with my PhD students in the designing and implementation of methods to train lightweight ViTs from scratch. This approach not only aims to reduce reliance on generic pre-trained weights but also tailors the model to be more resource-efficient and adaptable to specific domains. Furthermore, recognizing the critical significance of healthcare imaging data, I am directing efforts towards the creation of a specialized ViTs model exclusively tailored for the complexities of medical imaging. This involves a detailed exploration of the unique characteristics and challenges posed by healthcare datasets, ensuring that the model is finely tuned to extract meaningful insights and patterns relevant to medical diagnostic applications. The overarching goal of this research is to contribute to the evolution of vision transformers, making them more versatile, domain-specific, and resource-efficient, particularly in the context of crucial domains such as healthcare.
