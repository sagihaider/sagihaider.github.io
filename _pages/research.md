My passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning sparked during my BTech Degree at Integral University, Lucknow, India, in the academic year 2007-2008. Since then, I have delved into various facets of AI. The word cloud presented below showcases the key themes and keywords encapsulating my research endeavors.

The picture that changed my life is given below. The picture is from the book ``Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach`` by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The first chapter of the book is an introduction to AI and I read it in 2007. I would say no one can explain it much better than this book.
