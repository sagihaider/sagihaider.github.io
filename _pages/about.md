I am an India-born British computer scientist and currently working as a Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE), University of Essex (UoE). From Nov 2020-Nov 2022, I worked as a Lecturer in CSEE and from Nov 2017-Nov 2022, I worked as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS), UoE. Prior to joining UoE, I worked as Post-Doctoral Research Officer in Machine Learning at The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, Swansea University, UK (July 2016 - Present). Before joining Swansea, I worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant in Machine Learning for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfacing at the Intelligent Systems Research Centre (ISRC), School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, Ulster University, UK (December 2015-June 2016). My doctoral (PhD) dissertation was under the supervision of Professor Girijesh Prasad and Dr Hubert Cecotti and looked at adaptive learning for modelling for non-stationary systems and its application to EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (October 2012-December 2015).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
