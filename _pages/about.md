I am an India-born British computer scientist and currently working as a Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering), [University of Essex (UoE)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). From Nov 2020-Nov 2022, I worked as a Lecturer in CSEE and from Nov 2017-Nov 2022, I worked as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/institute-for-analytics-and-data-science), UoE. Prior to joining UoE, I worked as Post-Doctoral Research Officer in Machine Learning at The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/), UK (July 2016 - Present). Before joining Swansea, I worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant in Machine Learning for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfacing at the Intelligent Systems Research Centre (ISRC), School of Computing and Intelligent Systems, [Ulster University](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/), UK (December 2015-June 2016). My doctoral (PhD) dissertation was under the supervision of Professor Girijesh Prasad and Dr Hubert Cecotti and looked at adaptive learning for modelling for non-stationary systems and its application to EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (October 2012-December 2015).

Biography
======
I received a PhD in Computer Science from University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, UK; Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Manav Rachna International University, India; and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Integral University](http://iul.ac.in/), India. I completed my primary and secondary education during 1991-2003 from Colvin Taluqdars' College in Lucknow, which is one of the oldest private schools in India. I was born in the city of Lucknow and spent nearly 24 years. Here is a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS2fpg-SdJ8) video if you want to see Lucknow. 


I am also associated with following professional bodies: 

* Fellow of the Higher Education Academy [(FHEA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/fellowship). 
* Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [(SMIEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/membership/senior/index1.html).

Research interests
======
My research interests include a range of fields within Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), including Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Vision Transformers (ViT), Domain Adaptation, Non-stationary Learning, and Electroencephalography (EEG)/Magnetoencephalography (MEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). I also researched in Robotics related to BCI-based Neuro-Rehabilitation. With substantial expertise, I have been involved in the development, testing, and deployment of intelligent learning systems across diverse applications. These applications span from robotics to medical imaging (EEG & MEG), healthcare systems (such as skin-cancer detection and forensic dentistry), and addressing real-world challenges in the NHS, UK. My research extends across the entire spectrum, covering foundational ML and explainable AI (xAI) theories to practical implementations in real-world scenarios. One of my primary focuses is on influencing policies to ensure the safe and ethical adoption of ML technologies.

I am associated to the following research groups at the University of Essex:
1. Artificial Intelligence and explainable AI
2. Brain-Computer Interfacing
3. Computer Vision
