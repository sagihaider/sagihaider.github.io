## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centres on the belief that education is a transformative, collaborative, and lifelong process. As an educator, I see myself not merely as a transmitter of knowledge but as a facilitator of critical thinking, curiosity, and personal growth. My goal is to create a learning environment where students feel empowered to ask questions, engage with ideas, and explore the practical implications of what they learn.

At the University of Essex, I have had the privilege of leading modules such as **CE880 (An Approachable Introduction to Data Science)** and **CE888 (Data Science and Decision Making)**, both of which I have enhanced with current research topics, real-world applications, and industry-standard tools such as Google Colab. These innovations not only improved student engagement but were recognised with outstanding SAMT feedback scores.

I believe teaching and research are deeply interconnected. Leading the **Lovelace group** for five academic years, I introduced real-world machine learning competitions via Kaggle, placing Essex students in the global top 5%. This approach exposed students to the rigour and excitement of applied data science from the outset of their academic journey.

I place a strong emphasis on **inclusive, active learning**, using lectures, case studies, and hands-on exercises to accommodate diverse learning styles. I also support students beyond the classroom through extensive supervision at undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral levels.

Looking ahead, I am passionate about developing advanced modules in **Explainable AI** and **Brain-Computer Interfaces**, particularly for healthcare applications. These will combine ethical awareness, technical rigour, and interdisciplinary collaboration to prepare students for responsible leadership in AI.

Ultimately, my teaching philosophy is rooted in empowering students not just to succeed academically, but to become thoughtful innovators and contributors to society.
